      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <h3>Hello! My name is Alyssa, here's some info about me:</h3>
      <h3>I'm a student who still currently attends highschool, and currently pursuing to eventually become a physical therapist(PT)!</h3>
      <h3>I tend to rant a lot, which was the reasoning behind the theme of this website. Some lessons on this website are not only from events that affected me personally, but from others who I've had close friendships with.</h3>
      <h3>Regarding this website, I'll update once in a while! Trying not to ditch :)</h3>
